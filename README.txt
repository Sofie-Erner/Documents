This repository contains files on projects I have completed during my university degree and in high school.

Computational_Lab_Report is a report on the estimation of pi using Monte Carlo Simulation.

Numerical_Methods_1 is a report for a third year university course called "Numerical Methods".
It contains code and calculations concerning the topics; Gaussian Elimination, Interpolation, and Root Finding (Bisection Method, Secant Method, and Newton-Raphson Method).

Quark_Gluon_Plasma is a literature report I wrote in my second year of university concerning the properties of quark gluon plasma together with a short description of its discovery. 

Radioactivity_Report is a laboratory report written by myself and a fellow student in our second year of university concerning a series of experiments on radioactivity.
